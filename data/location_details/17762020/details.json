{"location_id": "17762020", "name": "Mcmenamins Elk Temple", "description": "he 1916 Elks Temple has been restored and reimagined into a vibrant gathering place for out-of-town guests and locals alike. From the Old Hangout, a bar reminiscent of world travels, to the Spanish Ballroom, a grand space hosting live music, you\u2019ll find entertainment at every turn. Threads of art, history and elements of the local community are woven into the structure. Wherever you are in Elks Temple, you\u2019ll find the comforts of your favorite neighborhood pub and a world of adventure. We wanted to see how much fun we could pack into seven floors, so we started with a McMenamins Brewery, the Bottle Shop & Brewery Tasting Room, and The Old Hangout on the ground floor, and worked our way up. Take the scenic route up the Spanish Steps to the Spanish Bar and Ballroom on the second floor before wending your way to Doc\u2019s, a third floor games bar overlooking the ballroom; pause on the nearby mezzanine overlooking Puget Sound. On the fourth floor stop for a celebratory meal (you\u2019re halfway to the top!) in McMenamins Pub where expansive views of Puget Sound\u2019s Commencement Bay and the marina at Foss Waterway dominate the east-facing windows. Once you\u2019ve refueled for the rest of your journey, continue to the diminutive fifth floor \u2013 if you can find it. From there it\u2019s on up to the sixth floor guestrooms and a spectacular overhead array of lights, lamps and chandeliers. Travel your last flight to seven, where guestrooms overlook the lush indoor atrium and give you an eye-level view of the light display like no other. Whether your port of call is the Old Hangout, the Spanish Bar, Doc\u2019s or the Spanish Ballroom, you\u2019ll find handcrafted cocktails, tales from home and afar, cozy hideaways and untold fun. A Little History The Elks Temple was built in the second Renaissance Revival style in 1915-16 when fraternal organizations were an important part of the community and had the money to build beautiful buildings such as this one. It was designed by \u00c9. Fr\u00e8re Champney, a graduate of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. It is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Spanish Steps Climbing the hillside adjacent to the building is a stairway called the Spanish Steps. Modeled after the Scalinata di Spagna in Rome, Tacoma\u2019s Spanish Steps were constructed in 1916 to connect a streetcar line on Broadway with City Hall on Commerce Street. The staircase fell into disrepair in the 1950s and continued to degrade until it was rehabilitated by the City of Tacoma in 2011.", "web_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g58775-d17762020-Reviews-Mcmenamins_Elk_Temple-Tacoma_Washington.html?m=66827", "address_obj": {"street1": "565 Broadway", "city": "Tacoma", "state": "Washington", "country": "United States", "postalcode": "98402-3907", "address_string": "565 Broadway, Tacoma, WA 98402-3907"}, "ancestors": [{"level": "City", "name": "Tacoma", "location_id": "58775"}, {"abbrv": "WA", "level": "State", "name": "Washington", "location_id": "28968"}, {"level": "Country", "name": "United States", "location_id": "191"}], "latitude": "47.258015", "longitude": "-122.440834", "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles", "write_review": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g58775-d17762020-Mcmenamins_Elk_Temple-Tacoma_Washington.html?m=66827", "ranking_data": {"geo_location_id": "58775", "ranking_string": "#13 of 28 hotels in Tacoma", "geo_location_name": "Tacoma", "ranking_out_of": "28", "ranking": "13"}, "rating": "3.5", "rating_image_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/3.5-66827-5.svg", "num_reviews": "40", "review_rating_count": {"1": "7", "2": "6", "3": "1", "4": "11", "5": "15"}, "subratings": {"0": {"name": "rate_location", "localized_name": "Location", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.5.svg", "value": "4.6"}, "1": {"name": "rate_sleep", "localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.svg", "value": "3.8"}, "2": {"name": "rate_room", "localized_name": "Rooms", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.5.svg", "value": "4.3"}, "3": {"name": "rate_service", "localized_name": "Service", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.svg", "value": "4.2"}, "4": {"name": "rate_value", "localized_name": "Value", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.5.svg", "value": "3.3"}, "5": {"name": "rate_cleanliness", "localized_name": "Cleanliness", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.svg", "value": "4.9"}}, "photo_count": "31", "see_all_photos": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g58775-d17762020-m66827-Reviews-Mcmenamins_Elk_Temple-Tacoma_Washington.html#photos", "price_level": "$$$", "amenities": ["Restaurant", "Bar/Lounge", "Free Wifi", "Non-smoking rooms", "Air conditioning", "English", "Room service", "Free Internet", "Pets Allowed", "Wifi", "Safe", "Clothes Rack", "24-Hour Front Desk", "iPod Docking Station", "Iron", "Private Bathrooms", "Telephone"], "category": {"name": "hotel", "localized_name": "Hotel"}, "subcategory": [{"name": "hotel", "localized_name": "Hotel"}], "styles": ["Quaint", "Hidden Gem"], "neighborhood_info": [], "trip_types": [{"name": "business", "localized_name": "Business", "value": "2"}, {"name": "couples", "localized_name": "Couples", "value": "9"}, {"name": "solo", "localized_name": "Solo travel", "value": "1"}, {"name": "family", "localized_name": "Family", "value": "7"}, {"name": "friends", "localized_name": "Friends getaway", "value": "2"}], "awards": []}
